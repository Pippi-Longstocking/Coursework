How I implemented my program depends on the block state being at state 6 (or 1,1 in a matrix).
This means I'll have 12 states in my output which will identify the block state.

Compile Instructions:
javac *.java
java mazeDriver <input.txt> where input.txt is similiar to the reinforcement_maze.txt provided
