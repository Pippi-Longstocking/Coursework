# Coursework
This repository holds undergraduate coursework relating to all computer science courses.

## CSC_1300 (Introduction to Programming and Logic)
Digital computers; problem solving and algorithm development; programming is introduced using a procedural approach, but classes and object-orientation are introduced; design and testing are emphasized.  Students complete a series of weekly laboratory exercises for developing proficiency in problem solving and computer programming.

## CSC_1310 (Data Structures and Algorithms)
Digital computers; problem solving and algorithm development; programming is introduced using a procedural approach, but classes and object-orientation are introduced; design and testing are emphasized.  Students complete a series of weekly laboratory exercises for developing proficiency in problem solving and computer programming.

## CSC_2310 (Object-Oriented Programming and Design)
Theory and practice of object-oriented programming and design. Encapsulation, inheritance, dynamic binding, and polymorphism; and introduction to UML and design patterns. Students complete a series of weekly laboratory exercises for developing proficiency in object-oriented programming and design.

## CSC_2400 (Design of Algorithms)
Advanced data structures and applications, problem solving strategies, heuristics, and complexity of algorithms.  MATH 1920 may be taken concurrently.

## CSC_2500 (Unix Laboratory)
Introduction to UNIX operating systems, the facilities, tools, and development procedures in an environment designed for systems programming.  Prerequisites may be taken concurrently.

## CSC_2903 (DevOps)

## CSC_3300 (Database Management)
Organization and management of large data files; data definition; database models; query languages; crash recovery; concurrency control; and case studies.

## CSC_3040 (Professionalism, Communication, and Research in Computing)
Social, ethical, and career aspects of computing.  Written, oral, and audio-visual communication in computer science; presentation techniques, report preparation, and technical correspondence.  Introduction to research in computing.

## CSC_4240 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)
### Description 
A unified survey of AI methods and applications; search and problem solving; knowledge representation; methods of reasoning, planning and uncertainty; learning, perception and communication; and rational agents
#### Program_1
Implements a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem. Mutation is avoided by iterating over chromosome and replacing duplicate cities with unique cities.
#### Program_2
Implements value iteration to obtain the optimal policy of the maze below.
