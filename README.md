# Coursework
This repository holds undergraduate coursework relating to all computer science courses.

## CSC_1300 (Introduction to Programming and Logic)
Digital computers; problem solving and algorithm development; programming is introduced using a procedural approach, but classes and object-orientation are introduced; design and testing are emphasized.  Students complete a series of weekly laboratory exercises for developing proficiency in problem solving and computer programming.

## CSC_1310 (Data Structures and Algorithms)
Digital computers; problem solving and algorithm development; programming is introduced using a procedural approach, but classes and object-orientation are introduced; design and testing are emphasized.  Students complete a series of weekly laboratory exercises for developing proficiency in problem solving and computer programming.

## CSC_2310 (Object-Oriented Programming and Design)
Theory and practice of object-oriented programming and design. Encapsulation, inheritance, dynamic binding, and polymorphism; and introduction to UML and design patterns. Students complete a series of weekly laboratory exercises for developing proficiency in object-oriented programming and design.

## CSC_2400 (Design of Algorithms)
Advanced data structures and applications, problem solving strategies, heuristics, and complexity of algorithms.  MATH 1920 may be taken concurrently.

## CSC_2500 (Unix Laboratory)
Introduction to UNIX operating systems, the facilities, tools, and development procedures in an environment designed for systems programming.  Prerequisites may be taken concurrently.

## CSC_2903 (DevOps)
